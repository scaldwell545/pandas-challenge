-- Men make up the vast majority of users (84.03%) compared to female
	and other-gendered users. However, men as a group spend
	less than other gender groups on average total purchase
	per person with $4.07 per purchase compared to $4.47 and
	$4.56 per purchase for women and other-gendered users,
	respectively.

-- The age group distribution is unimodal and is centered around the
	age group of 20-24 years old. This age group has the third 
	highest average total purchase per person with $4.32. The two
	groups with the first and second highest average purchase per 
	person, respectively, are 35-39 years old with $4.76 per person
	and sub-10 years old with $4.54 per person.

-- The most profitable and most popular item purchased by users was
	'Final Critic' with 13 purchases for $59.99. Two other items
	were among both the top 5 most popular items as well as the 
	top 5 most profitable items- 'Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the
	Breaking Storm' was second on metrics with 12 purchases for
	$50.79, and 'Fiery Glass Crusader' was the third most popular
	purchase with 9 purchases for $44.10, ranking fourth on the
	list of most profitable items. Two items ('Persuasion' and 
	'Extraction, Quickblade of Trembling Hands') were among
	the most popular items but were not nearly as profitable as
	the other items on the list mentioned earlier, indicating that
	they might warrant a price increase.
